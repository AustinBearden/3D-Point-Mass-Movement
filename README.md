# PhysicsFoosball
Will keep track of my progress of particular components of my Physics engine for my virtual foosball game.

Project 1:

  Model the movement of a ball in 3D space. Takel the problem twice. Each time with a different approach
    
     Approach 1: Write the program in .js and use a fullfledged physics engine to model the movements
     
     <a href="https://github.com/AustinBearden/PhysicsFoosball/tree/Approach_2">Approach 2:</a> Write the program in .js but this time don't use any physics libraries, write the whole program yourself
